This repository contains all the codes and other documents related to the manuscript Kuehn et al 2021. 


R CODES and ASSOCIATED SPREADSHEETS

R codes for all three analyses below are in the "analysis.rmd" file. (The bootstrap is running with 10,000 iterations right now, which will probably take a while (maybe 5-10 minutes) if you just run the code, so if you want to run the code faster, just set nboot (on line 64) to a smaller number.)

1) Dataset 01: Vasa cluster analysis in control worms
2) Dataset 02: Low and High density culturing experiment analyis 
3) Dataset 03: P10-P20 amputation experiment analysis


IMAGE ANALYSIS FILES (COMING SOON)
1) Low and High density culturing experiment scoring
2) P10-P20 amputation experiment scoring


HCR PROBE GENERATOR

This program written by Ryan Null allows you ease of ordering probes that mesh with the published HCR system of reaction and amplification reagents. https://github.com/rwnull/insitu_probe_generator 


PROTOCOLS

1) Özpolat Lab fixation protocol
2) Özpolat Lab in situ hybridization protocol
3) Özpolat Lab HCR protocol (with Bria Metzger and Dr. Ryan Null's changes to the original Choi et al 2018 protocol)
